# APEX-offline
offline analysis of APEX data (PR-10-009, E12-10-009)

Built as a user-made library to extend version 1.7.7 of the Hall-A Analyzer (https://github.com/JeffersonLab/analyzer). 

A lot of this is copied from the 'THaXXX' classes that are also present in that repo (under the HallA file). The parts which have been modified are optimized for analaysis of the 2019-run APEX data.
